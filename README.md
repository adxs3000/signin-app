# Task-1-Xenonstack-I have built a webpage for corporate signIn and SignUp using HTML, CSS, JS. 
# The basic design was made in HTML and all the coloring and allingments were done through CSS and you will see when you will click on the signin button the signup button gets diabled and there is a shift in the underline that was done in JS.
# Due to shortage of time I was not able to make all 3 pages but I know what I am capable of and I can assure you that I will be an asset to your company not a liability. I want this chance and I am willing to learn anything and Everything. Give me a chance.
